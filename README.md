# React-native-facebook-comments
Implementing facebook alike comments using react native (still working on it)


To do :

1-displaying number of likes.

2-Adding logic to replies

3-Separating text input component from commentsList component to avoid outer scrolling views issues.

4-Adding sorting prop to control how comments are sorted.

5-Adding color props.
