# React-native-facebook-comments
Implementing facebook alike comments using react native (still working on it)


Things not done yet:

1-displaying number of likes.
2-Adding logic to replies

To do :

1-Separating text input component from commentsList component to avoid outer scrolling views issues.

2-Adding sorting prop to control how comments are sorted.

3-Adding color props.
